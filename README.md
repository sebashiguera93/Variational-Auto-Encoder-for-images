# Variational-Auto-Encoder-for-images
*By: Sebastian Higuera Pedraza*

This project will introduce the Variational Auto Encoder for processing images, using CelebA dataset in Python.


The aim of this project is to introduce the Variational Auto Encoder, both theoretically and practically.

For this purpose, I'll use CelebA data set, a very popular data set for training Deep Neural Networks. It is also commonly used for pedagogical purposes.

First, I'll introduce the traditional Autoencoder from the deep learning perspective, and afterwards I'll introduce the Variational Auto Encoder.

This project involves also a REPORT.md file, where I present in some detail the methodology used, both the autoencoder and the VAE, with some code that explains how it is implemented in Python. There is also a file called 'Variational Auto Encoder TSE.ipynb', where all the code is implemented and the CelebA dataset is analyzed. Also, all the results of the application are presented here in detail.

This project shows how autoencoder and VAE are really usefull for reducing the dimension of a dataset, while keeping the most relevant information, but also, in the case of VAE, for generating new images.
